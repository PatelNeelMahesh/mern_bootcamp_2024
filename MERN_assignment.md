# MERN Stack Project Assignment

## Objective

Enhance your MERN stack project by integrating MongoDB for data storage, developing RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, and deploying your applications. This assignment will assess your ability to work with the full stack, from database operations to front-end integration and deployment.

### Project Statement

Your project statement has already been finalized. The task is to implement the backend to store JSON data related to your project statement in MongoDB and create the necessary RESTful APIs to interact with this data. Additionally, the front end should be capable of performing operations like displaying, adding, and deleting data through a user interface.

## Backend Tasks

1. **Database Integration**

   - Store some JSON data in MongoDB related to your project statement.

2. **RESTful API Development**

   - Write a **GET** API to fetch data from your MongoDB database.
   - Implement a **POST** API to allow adding new data to the database.
   - Create a **DELETE** API to remove data from the database.
   - **Bonus Task**: Implement **PUT/PATCH** API to update existing data in the database. Completing this task will grant you additional scores.

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy your RESTful APIs on Render.

## Frontend Tasks

1. **React Integration**

   - Call the GET API in a React Component and iterate over the JSON objects stored in MongoDB to display them in your application.

2. **Form Handling**

   - Create a form in one of the components to allow users to input values. On form submission, data should be stored in MongoDB through your POST API.
   - Implement functionality to delete data from the database using your DELETE API, triggered by user actions in the React application.

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy your React application on Netlify or Render.

## Bonus Task

- Completing the PUT/PATCH request functionality in both backend and frontend will be considered a bonus task and will be rewarded with additional points.

## Submission Guidelines

- Your code for both backend and frontend should be pushed to your GitHub repository.
- Include a `README.md` file in your repository with:
  - Instructions on what you have implemented today.
  - Links to the deployed applications on Render (for backend) and Netlify/Render (for frontend).

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: All basic tasks should be completed and working as expected.
- Deployment: Both applications should be accessible online through the provided URLs.
- Bonus: Implementation of the bonus task will be a plus.

Good luck with your assignment!
