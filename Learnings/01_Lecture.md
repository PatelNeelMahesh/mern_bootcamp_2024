3. Use illustrations and icons to make the UI better.

4. Use stock photos from pixabay, pexels, unsplash etc.

    ## Backgrounds and CSS Gradients

    Using SVG in background images is a smart choice for web designers and developers looking for high-quality, responsive, and efficient solutions. SVGs provide a wide range of benefits, from scalability and small file sizes to accessibility and interactivity, making them a versatile choice for a variety of web design applications.

Notes: 
- Websites stores user activity to provide relatable content with the help of cookies. We cannot store a lot of cookies. So, we use a db reddis which provides 
cache memory and is a little expensive.

- In mySql we provide structured data, while in mongodb we store unstructured data in JSON format. We cannot store JSon data in mySql but we can store both structured and nonstructured data in postgreSql.

- IT's easier to fetch data from structured data while in unstructured data it's easier to add data in mongodb.

- PostgreSQL comes somewhere in between, easier to both fetch and add data but it's difficult to implement.

Databases used in large scale projects: 
1. Redis (NoSql)
2. MongoDB (NoSql)
3. MySql (Sql) 
4. PostgreSQL

For backend - Focus on DB very well.

## Figma 

- List all the objectives of the design. 
- Target all the problems individually and create separate screen for each page
- Lable all the screen for better readibility.
- Prototypes are used to add functionality or link different screens.
- Creating prototypes takes time.
- Before developing the frontend website, the protoype is referred. 
- Clinet requirements -> Figma Design -> Prototype -> Frontend.

- Hig-Fid : Design with a lot more details.
- Low-Fid : Design with less details. Usually ignoring colors and things.

Sometimes we are not sure what component we require, so we create low fid designs to present to the team and decide whether to move forward with the component and add details. 

UI KITS : Figma tool used to create designs quickly with the help of predefined components using drag and drop.

Create Design + Code

Use Figma to convert png to svg formats. Importing and exporting in figma is very easy and handy.

Figma design can also be used to generate code through generative AI tools.

Know the basics of everything.

Take inspiration from good website for your website.

How to get started

Choose colors -> Choose illustration -> Start Figma -> Create prototype.
