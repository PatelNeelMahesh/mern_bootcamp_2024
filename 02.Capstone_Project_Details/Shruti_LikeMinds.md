- Which problem Project is Solving?

  After having completed 2 years of offline college I have realised the importance of having the right people around you.
  The people you surround yourself with really matters. But finding like-minded people in the college, who are as ambitious as you are,
  as compeititive as you are, having similar interests and learning patterns was a challenge. Therefore, I want to build a platform wherein
  students of similar domain of interests can come together, learn together, build together and ultimately grow together.

- What are existing similar solutions?

  - [Add all the possible feature that comes to your mind, take inspiration from existing solution on what's alrady done right, along with how you can make it better.]
