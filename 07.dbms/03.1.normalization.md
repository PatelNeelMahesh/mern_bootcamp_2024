## **1 — Understanding the Need for Normalization**

### **1. What Is Normalization**

Normalization is the process of **organizing data in a database** so that each piece of information is stored **only once** and in the **right place**.
Think of it like arranging your files:

* One folder for investors,
* One for mutual funds,
* One for transactions — instead of mixing everything in a single messy folder.

---

### **2. Let’s Start with a Simple, Messy Table**

Imagine a financial tracking system that records mutual-fund investments.
Here’s a single table someone created quickly:

| InvestorID | InvestorName | Mobile     | FundName            | Category  | Units | NAV    | InvestDate |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| I001       | Arjun Patel  | 9991112222 | Axis Bluechip Fund  | Large Cap | 100   | 45.30  | 2025-01-10 |
| I001       | Arjun Patel  | 9991112222 | ICICI Balanced Fund | Hybrid    | 50    | 120.50 | 2025-02-15 |
| I002       | Yashvi Shah  | 9993334444 | Axis Bluechip Fund  | Large Cap | 200   | 45.30  | 2025-03-05 |
| I003       | Mahir Mehta  | 9995556666 | HDFC Small Cap Fund | Small Cap | 150   | 25.80  | 2025-02-25 |
| I002       | Yashvi Shah  | 9993334444 | ICICI Balanced Fund | Hybrid    | 30    | 120.50 | 2025-04-01 |

At first glance it looks fine — all the data you need is here.
But underneath, several serious problems exist.

### **3. Spot the Problems — the “Anomalies”**

#### **(a) Redundancy**

* Arjun Patel’s name and mobile number appear **twice**.
* Yashvi Shah’s details appear **twice**.
* Fund details like “Axis Bluechip Fund – Large Cap – 45.30” appear **multiple times**.
  Every repetition means more storage, more data entry, and more risk of inconsistency.

#### **(b) Update Anomaly**

Suppose the NAV (Net Asset Value) of *Axis Bluechip Fund* changes from **45.30 → 47.00**.
You must now update **every row** where that fund appears.
If you miss even one row, the database shows two different NAVs for the same fund.

#### **(c) Insert Anomaly**

You want to register a **new fund**, “Kotak ELSS Tax Saver,” before any investor buys it.
This table structure **doesn’t allow** inserting the fund alone — you’d have to fake an investor or leave investor columns NULL.
That’s an **insert anomaly**.

#### **(d) Delete Anomaly**

If Arjun sells all his units and you delete his rows, you’ll also lose the only record of “Axis Bluechip Fund” if no one else holds it.
That’s an **accidental loss of valuable metadata** — a delete anomaly.

---

### **4. Why These Anomalies Are Dangerous**

* **Data inconsistency:** Two copies of the same fact might disagree.
* **Integrity issues:** You can’t trust one source of truth.
* **Poor scalability:** As investors and funds grow, the risk multiplies.
* **Complex updates:** Every change requires manual cross-checking.

In financial systems like mutual funds, where values (NAVs, categories) change frequently, these issues can create reporting errors, compliance problems, and financial misstatements.

---

### **5. Where Normalization Comes In**

Normalization provides **structured rules** that reorganize such data into **multiple related tables**, so that:

* Each fact is stored once.
* Relationships are explicit (through keys).
* Updates, inserts, and deletes work predictably.

We’ll progressively fix the earlier table by applying **normal forms**:

1. **1NF — Atomicity**
2. **2NF — Remove partial dependencies**
3. **3NF — Remove transitive dependencies**
4. **BCNF — Ensure all determinants are keys**
   (and optionally 4NF/5NF for advanced design)

Each form eliminates a specific kind of anomaly.

### **6. Recap of Part 1**

| Concept               | Meaning                               | Mutual-Fund Example                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Redundancy            | Same data repeated                    | Investor name and fund info appear in many rows |
| Update Anomaly        | Change required in multiple places    | Updating NAV in several rows                    |
| Insert Anomaly        | Can’t add data independently          | Can’t insert new fund without investor          |
| Delete Anomaly        | Deleting a row removes unrelated info | Removing investor deletes fund info             |
| Goal of Normalization | Store each fact once, link logically  | Separate investors, funds, holdings             |
