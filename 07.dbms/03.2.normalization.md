## **2 — First Normal Form (1NF): Making Data Atomic**

### **1. What Does 1NF Actually Mean?**

> **Every column in a table must hold a single, indivisible value, and every row must be unique.**

This means:

* No lists or sets inside a single cell.
* No repeating groups like “Fund1, Fund2, Fund3.”
* Each row represents **one fact** about one entity instance.
* There’s a clear **primary key** that uniquely identifies each row.

### **2. Returning to Our Unnormalized Mutual-Fund Table**

| InvestorID | InvestorName | Mobile     | FundNames                               | Categories        | Units   | NAVs          | InvestDates            |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| I001       | Arjun Patel  | 9991112222 | Axis Bluechip Fund, ICICI Balanced Fund | Large Cap, Hybrid | 100, 50 | 45.30, 120.50 | 2025-01-10, 2025-02-15 |
| I002       | Yashvi Shah  | 9993334444 | Axis Bluechip Fund, ICICI Balanced Fund | Large Cap, Hybrid | 200, 30 | 45.30, 120.50 | 2025-03-05, 2025-04-01 |
| I003       | Mahir Mehta  | 9995556666 | HDFC Small Cap Fund                     | Small Cap         | 150     | 25.80         | 2025-02-25             |

This is clearly *not atomic* — several columns store multiple comma-separated values.
Such storage is impossible to query reliably (you can’t join, sort, or aggregate correctly).

---

### **3. Converting to Atomic Values**

We now **split each multi-valued row into separate rows**, one row per unique investor–fund combination.

| HoldingID | InvestorID | InvestorName | Mobile     | FundName            | Category  | Units | NAV    | InvestDate |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| H001      | I001       | Arjun Patel  | 9991112222 | Axis Bluechip Fund  | Large Cap | 100   | 45.30  | 2025-01-10 |
| H002      | I001       | Arjun Patel  | 9991112222 | ICICI Balanced Fund | Hybrid    | 50    | 120.50 | 2025-02-15 |
| H003      | I002       | Yashvi Shah  | 9993334444 | Axis Bluechip Fund  | Large Cap | 200   | 45.30  | 2025-03-05 |
| H004      | I002       | Yashvi Shah  | 9993334444 | ICICI Balanced Fund | Hybrid    | 30    | 120.50 | 2025-04-01 |
| H005      | I003       | Mahir Mehta  | 9995556666 | HDFC Small Cap Fund | Small Cap | 150   | 25.80  | 2025-02-25 |

Now:

* Every field contains one value only.
* Each row can be identified uniquely by `HoldingID` (or a composite key such as `(InvestorID, FundName, InvestDate)`).

That’s **1NF** achieved.

### **4. Why This Matters**

| Before (UNF)                                     | After (1NF)                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data inside cells were lists                     | Each cell holds a single value                         |
| Hard to search by a single fund                  | Easy to query: `WHERE FundName = 'Axis Bluechip Fund'` |
| No unique key                                    | Each row now distinct                                  |
| Difficult to insert individual fund transactions | Can insert one record per holding easily               |

### **5. Small SQL Illustration**

```sql
CREATE TABLE InvestorHoldings_1NF (
  HoldingID VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
  InvestorID VARCHAR(10),
  InvestorName VARCHAR(100),
  Mobile VARCHAR(15),
  FundName VARCHAR(200),
  Category VARCHAR(50),
  Units DECIMAL(12,4),
  NAV DECIMAL(10,2),
  InvestDate DATE
);
```

**Example Query**

```sql
SELECT InvestorName, FundName, Units, NAV
FROM InvestorHoldings_1NF
WHERE Category = 'Large Cap';
```

### **6. What We’ve Fixed and What’s Still Wrong**

**Fixed**

* Atomic values ✅
* Rows uniquely identifiable ✅
* Easy to filter and aggregate ✅

**Still Wrong**

* Redundancy remains (investor details and fund details repeat).
* Changing a fund’s category or NAV requires multiple updates.
* Deleting an investor row might delete all fund info inadvertently.

So, while 1NF gives *basic order*, the table still suffers from **partial dependency** problems — that’s what **Second Normal Form (2NF)** resolves.

### **7. Quick Recap**

| Key Idea      | Plain Meaning                                  | Mutual-Fund Example                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1NF Rule      | Each cell holds one value, each row unique     | Split multi-fund rows into one row per fund         |
| Why Important | Enables reliable searching, indexing, and keys | Can query or update one holding cleanly             |
| Still Pending | Redundant investor/fund info                   | Arjun’s name, Yashvi’s name, etc. appear repeatedly |
