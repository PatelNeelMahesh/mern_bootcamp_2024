# Working with Git and GitHub: A Practical Guide

A practical guide to using Git and GitHub, tailored for participants of the MERN course.

## Setting Up Your Repository

### Cloning a Repository

To start working on a project, you first need to clone it to your local machine. Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository's URL.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codinggita/example-repo.git
```

### Checking Status

Once you have made changes in your repository, you can use `git status` to see which changes are staged, which are not, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

```bash
git status
```

## Making Changes

### Adding Changes

To add your changes to the staging area, use `git add`. The `.` after `git add` means you are adding all the changed files.

```bash
git add .
```

### Committing Changes

After staging your changes, you need to commit them with a message describing what you've done. A good commit message should be clear, concise, and explain what changes were made and why. It helps team members understand your changes without needing to read the code.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## Synchronizing with the Remote Repository

### Pushing Changes

To send your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub, use `git push`.

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Pulling Changes

To update your local repository with changes from the remote, use `git pull`.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Additional Commands

### Stashing Changes

If you need to switch branches but aren't ready to commit your current work, you can use `git stash` to temporarily store the changes.

```bash
git stash
```

### Switching Branches

To switch to a different branch, use `git checkout` followed by the branch name.

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### Conclusion

Understanding these Git commands is essential for efficient collaboration and version control in software development. As you progress through the MERN bootcamp, these commands will become integral to your daily workflow. Remember, a well-crafted commit message is key to maintaining a readable and manageable codebase.
