# Pull Request (PR)

When making a pull request (PR) on GitHub or any other version control system, there are several common mistakes to avoid, and there are specific aspects of writing code that you should focus on to ensure a smooth review and merge process. Here are some of the most common mistakes and key aspects to consider:

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

1. **Large and Unfocused PRs:**

   - Submitting large PRs with multiple unrelated changes can overwhelm reviewers and make it harder to pinpoint issues. Keep your PRs focused on specific tasks or features.

2. **Not Addressing Comments:**

   - Ignoring feedback and comments from reviewers can lead to delays in the review process. Be responsive and address all feedback and suggestions promptly.

3. **Lack of Documentation:**

   - Failing to update or provide documentation for your changes can hinder other developers' understanding of your code. Include clear and concise documentation as needed.

4. **Not Testing on Different Environments:**

   - Code that works on your local development environment may not work the same way on other systems. Test your changes on different environments and platforms, including production-like environments.

5. **Including Debugging or Temporary Code:**
   - Avoid committing code with debug statements, commented-out code, or temporary hacks. Clean up your code before submitting a PR.
